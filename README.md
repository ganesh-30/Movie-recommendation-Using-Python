## Features

- Recommends movies similar to a given movie title
- Uses content-based filtering
- Processes movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, crew, etc.)
- NLP techniques: TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity
- User-friendly implementation in a Jupyter Notebook

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
